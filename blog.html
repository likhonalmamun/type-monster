      <h1 class="green">
        What are the differences between Localstorage and Sessionstorage ?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Localstorage and Sessionstorage are almost similar . But there is some differences between them .
        The most important difference is the Sessionstorage is session based , so it clears itself on closing the tab or
        browser . But the Localstorage dosen't expire on closing the tab , window or browser . It stay saved in your
        local storage so you can access them when you return to browser .
        You can also modify or delete them mannualy .
        Sessionstorage persists untill you close the tab , window or browser .(It is unchanged on reload).
        But Localstorage persists untill the user mannualy clears it from browser.
        The other difference is Localstorage can store up to 10MB of data which is equal to 5 Millions of charecters .
        On the other hand , the local storage can store up to 5MB of data which is equal to 2.5 Millions of
        charecters.(As both of them stores data in string format)

      <h1 class="green">
        What are the differences between Global scope and block scope varriable ?
      </h1>
      <p>
        The variables which can be accessed everywhere in the code are called global scope varriable .
        And the varriables which can be accessed only in the range of particullar block(like if-else block , loop block
        , functional block etc.) are called block scope varriable.
        The varriable declared with var is global scoped varriable .(It's value will be undefined if you try to access
        it before initialized)
        On the other hand , the varriables declared with let or const are block scoped varriable.
        You can access a global scoped varriable anywhere in the code as well as in any block.
        But you can access a block scoped only in the particullar block where it is defined. (If it is declared outside
        of all blocks , it can be accessed everywhere.)

        How does event loop work in JS ?
      </h1>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a single threaded programming language . That means it can run a single operation at a time . It's
        true about syncronous operations. It blocks next operations untill it is exicuted.
        But there is some asyncronous operations in js that dosen't block other operations.
        The event loop is a constantly running procces that manages these syncronous and asyncronous operations and
        prevents the code engine from being blocked by a single task.
        The event loop pushes syncronous operations in call stack and the asyncronous operations to task queue.
        It exicute the operations from call stack one by one and paralally works on the asyncronous tasks.
        When the asyncronous operation is done , event loop waits for the call stack to be cleared . If the call stack
        is cleared , it pushes the asyncronous operation to call stack and the operation exicutes.
        That's how event loop works in JS and makes code faster .

      <h1 class="red">Question 4 :</h1>
      <h1 class="green">
        What are the causes for getting undefined value of any varriable ?
      </h1>
      <p>
        From the cases below , you might get undefined : <br>

        1. variable which is declared but value is not initialized. <br>
        2. function with out return statment. <br>
        3. the parameter which is not passed while calling a function. <br>
        4. function which do not have anything on right side of return. <br>
        5. property which dosen't exist in an object. <br>
        6. value of element out of index range in an array. <br>
        7. value of deleted element of an array. <br>
        8. varriable declared with var when it is accessed before initialized. <br>
        (Last but not the least)
        9. if you set the value of any varriable to undefined <br>
